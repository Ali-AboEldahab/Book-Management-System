# Simple Book Management System
**Project Features**
- Enter Number of Books: Provide a form or input field where the author can enter the number of books he want to add.

- Enter Data of Each Book: Once the author has entered the number of books, dynamically generate input fields for each book based on the entered number. These input fields could include details such as title, author name, author email, price, etc.

- Display Data of Each Book: After the author has entered the data for each book and submitted the form, display the entered data in a table format. Each row of the table represents a book, and each column represents a different attribute.

- Delete or Edit: Provide options for the Author to delete or edit the data of each book displayed in the table. This could be done with icons within each row of the table.

- Validation: Implement validation for the input fields to ensure that required fields are filled out and that data is in the correct format. Display error messages if validation fails, guiding the author on how to correct the input.
